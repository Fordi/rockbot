KYOTO IS UNDER ATTACK!
WE MUST FIND OUT THE ONE
BEHIND THIS AND STOP HIM!
DON'T WORRY DR. KANOTUS.
I SHALL FIND THIS BAD GUY
AND BRING HIM TO JUSTICE!
ROGER THAT.
I SHALL OBLITERATE
ANY OPPOSITION.
I'LL DO MY BEST, DOCTOR!
JUST HOPE NO ONE GETS
HURT.
THESE IDIOTS NEVER LEARN.
I WONDER IF THEY WILL
GIVE UP THIS TIME.
SO, YOU ARE ONE OF
THOSE ROBOT COPS?
COME AND GET ME!
THE NAME'S ROCKBOT.
LET'S SEE HOW TOUGHT
YOU ARE.
YES. I AM BETABOT.
RESISTANCE IS FUTILE.
SURRENDER OR FACE ME.
MY NAME IS CANDYBOT,
YOU BIG MEANIE! AND
I'M HERE TO STOP YOU!
THE NAMES' KITTYBOT, JERK.
SURRENDER NOW AND I WON'T
HURT YOU VERY MUCH.
WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE!
LET'S PLAY A GAME OF CRUSH
THE ROBOT. OOK!
YOU PIECE OF SCRAP! EEK!
I SHALL BRING YOU TO YOUR  
KNESS!
GAME? THIS ISN'T A GAME!
I WON'T LET YOU PLAY
WITH MY CITY.
GAMES ARE USELESS.
NO ANIMAL WILL STAND
IN MY WAY.
I'M GOOD AT GAMES! BUT,
IF I WIN, DO YOU PROMISE 
TO BEHAVE,  MISTER MONKEY?
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOUR
GAMES, FLEABAG.
EEEK! EEK! OOK!
OOK! OOOOOK! 
SORRY FRIEND, BUT
I DON'T SPEAK "MONKEY".
LANGUAGE NOT RECOGNIZED.
DOES NOT COMPUTE.
OH, YOU ARE SO CUTE!
I ALMOST FELL SORRY FOR
HITTING YOU.
MEAW, MEAW, MEAW.
ARE WE DONE BEING SILLY?
YOU ARE BRAVE, BUT MY
FLOWER POWER WILL PUT
YOU IN A DEEP SLEEP!
YOU UGLY ROBOT!
MOTHER NATURE SHALL ALWAYS 
PREVAIL OVER TECHNOLOGY.
SORRY PRINCESS, BUT
NOT ON THE FIRST DATE.
I DO NOT BREATHE OR SLEEP.
YOUR POWERS ARE WASTED
ON ME.
BUT IT'S NOT TIME FOR MY
BEAUTY SLEEP YET! CAN'T SAY
THE SAME FOR YOU, THOUGH.
I'M ALLERGIC TO FLOWERS
SO IT'S BEST IF YOU JUST
DISSAPEAR.
YOU HURT MY CUTE FRIENDS.
I WON'T FORGIVE YOU!!
STOP TALKING AND DIE!
I'M NOT FOND OF FIGHTING
GIRLS. CAN'T YOU SURRENDER
INSTEAD?
WARNING, USE OF FORCE IS
ALLOWED IN CASE OF HOSTILE
ATTACK.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO, THEY
ATTACKED ME! MAYBE WE 
CAN TALK ABOUT THIS?
COULDN'T CARE LESS, SISTER.
THEY SHOULD KNOWN BETTER
THAN TO STAND IN MY WAY.
IDIOTS! ANYONE WHO DARES
ENTER MY WATER DOMAIN
HAS TO PAY THE PRICE.
WHAT?! YOU MAGGOT!
LET'S HAVE US A LITTLE
CHAT ABOUT RESPECT.
CAN'T WE RUSH THIS?
MY CIRCUITS ARE GETTING
A LITTLE RUSTY.
NO MATTER HOW DEEP THE 
HOLE GOES, YOU CAN'T HIDE
FROM THE LAW.
PAY TO ENTER THE WATER?
THAT IS DUMB! AH, I SEE.
YOU'RE JUST A GOON!
LIKE I WOULD PAY ANYTHING
TO ENTER THIS SEWAGE DUMP.
YOU AGAIN? WHY CAN'T YOU
JUST DIE? YOU'RE FORCING ME
TO BRING OUT THE BIG GUNS!
THA'S IT! 
DIE! DIE! DIE!
OR MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE
YOURSELF UP?
JUST SAYING.
YOUR GUNS ARE INEFFECTIVE.
COME QUIETLY OR THERE WILL
BE TROUBLE.
GOSH, YOU'RE ANNOYING.
DON'T YOU GET TIRED OF
HEARING YOUR VOICE?
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL
A "BIG GUN"? DON'T MAKE
ME LAUGH.
I WONDER IF YOU ARE CAPABLE
OF SURVIVING THE SUN REALM.
THEN, THE DESERT'S DANGERS
SHALL FINISH YOU.
FLAME ONE, BANDAGE BOT!
YOUR LITTLE SAUNA IS
NOTHING I CAN'T TAKE!
CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.
NO HEAT IS ENOUGH TO MELT
MY CERAMIC ARMOUR.
NICE! THIS IS JUST LIKE
GOING TO THE BEACH! 
PIECE OF CAKE.
YOUR BRAIN MUST HAVE
SLIPPED THROUGH YOUR
NOSE IF YOU THINK I'M NOT.
DO YOU KNOW OF THE 
CURSE PROTECTING MY
PHARAOH'S TOMB?
THEN COME AND I'LL SHOW 
YOU HOW POWERFULL THE
SUN GOD IS. 
DON'T KNOWN, DON'T CARE!
CURSES WON'T PROTECT YOU
FROM ME!
CURSES ARE INEXISTANT.
MYTHS ARE NOT RECOGNIZED
AS ANY THREAT.
CURSES ARE BAD AND BAD BOTS
ALWAYS LOSE! DID NOBODY
TOLD YOU THAT?
CAN WE STOP THE CHITCHAT
AND WRAP THIS UP? I DON'T
WANT TO BE TIED UP HERE.
GREETINGS AND SALUTATIONS.
I WONDER, CAN YOU FOLLOW 
THE WHITE RABBIT?
REALLY? WELL, LOOK AT THE
TIME! HURRY OR HEADS
MAY ROLL!
WHAT? YOU'RE NOT MAKING
ANY SENSE, DUDE!
IT IS TOO LATE TO PLEDGE
INSANITY NOW.
YAY! I LOVE RABBITS!
THEY ARE SO FLUFFY!
WOW, YOUR MASTER REALLY DID
A NUMBER ON YOU, DIDN'T HE?
YOU'RE MAD AS A HATTER!
WONDERFUL! I KNEW YOU COULD
DO IT. NOW LET ME SHOW YOU
SOME REAL MAGIC.
AREN'T YOU JUST LOVELY?
COME ON! YOUR MAGIC 
AGAINST MY CANNON BLASTER.
I'LL TAKE MY SCIENCE OVER
YOUR MAGIC ANYDAY.
ARE YOU GOING TO PULL
A RABIT OUT OF YOUR
WEIRD POINTY HAT?
I'M GETTING REALLY TIRED OF
YOUR CHILDISH TRICKS, DEAR.
TIME TO GROW UP.
GET IN, STUPID ROBOT COPS!
I'LL SHOW YOU SOME NICE
FIREWORKS.
SMARTASS! I'LL SHOW YOU
WHO IS THE STUPID ONE HERE!
YOU WANT TO CELEBRATE
MY VICTORY ALREADY? 
HOW NICE OF YOU, ROCKHEAD.
REPEATED VIOLATIONS OF THE 
VERBAL MORALITY STATUE HAVE
BEEN ADDED TO YOUR RECORD.
WATCH THE LANGUAGE, MISTER!
GUESS I HAVE TO TEACH YOU
SOME MANNERS, DUMBO!
SUCH A RUDE LITTLE ROBOT!
LOOKS LIKE HE IS MISSING
A COUPLE OF SCREWS.
DAMN YOU! I'LL BURY YOU  
UNDER A TON OF ROCKS!.
KABOOM, KABOOM!
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T LET YOU
DO THAT, DYNAMITE.
YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.
IMMINENT EXPLOSION WARNING.
INITIATING EXTREME COUNTER
MEASURES.
OH NO, YOU WON'T!
I'M TOO PRETTY TO DIE
LIKE THIS!
OH COME ON, DARLING.
YOU WILL LEARN NOT TO MESS
WITH BIG BAD KITTIES.
IF YOU WANT TO REACH ME, 
YOU'LL HAVE TO AVOID
THE DEADLY TRAPS.
FOOL, YOU CAN'T ESCAPE.
I SHALL ENJOY SEEING YOU
PERISH HERE.
YOU CAN'T TRAP JUSTICE.
I WILL FIND YOU AND I WILL
STOP YOU!
THESE LITTLE NUISANCES
WON'T PROTECT YOU FOR
MUCH LONGER.
IT'S A TRAP? OOPS, SORRY!
I THOUGHT THEY WERE
JUST TOYS.
POOR ROBOT MOUSE,
HE THINKS HE CAN TRAP 
A CAT.
VERY WELL, SO WE FINALLY
MEET. CONGRATULATIONS!
NOW, GET READY TO DIE.
THANKS! BUT NO THANKS.
I CAN'T DIE UNTIL ALL THE
EVIL BOTS ARE GONE!
DEAD OR ALIVE, YOU'RE
COMING WITH ME.
NOT AGAIN! WHY DOES EVERY
BOT AROUND HERE HAS TO
BE SUCH A BULLY!
I HAVE A FEELING YOU ARE
ABOUT TO REGRET TOYING
WITH ME.
0100000101001100 
0100010101010010 
0101010000100001
YOU WHAT??
SORRY PAL, BUT I DO
NOT UNDERSTAND THAT.
IT'S TOO LATE FOR IT NOW.
YOU ARE ALREADY MY TARGET.
JEEZ, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE
SKIPPED THIS CLASS.
FOR YOUR SAKE, I HOPE
THAT GIBERISH WAS A 
COMPLIMENT.
IT IS NOT LOGICAL!
YOU ARE NOT SO STRONG.
E-X-T-E-R-M-I-N-A-T-E!!
EXTERMINATE!
ANNHILATE!
DESTROY!
EXTERMINATE? SURE, LET ME
SEE YOU TRY! OR IS THIS
JUST TOUGH TALK?
YOUR LOGIC IS FLAWED. 
YOU HAVE NOT THE POWER
TO EXTERMINATE ME.
EXTERMINATE ME? WHY?!
WAIT, I KNOW! YOU WANT  
MY BEAUTIFUL HAIR! 
MAD AND EVIL? PERFECT.
JUST WHAT I LIKE IN A BOT.
WELL, YOU CAN'T HAVE IT!
CATCH ME IF YOU CAN,
DARLING!
WELCOME TO MY FORTRESS.
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU ARE
MADE OF, LITTLE ONE.
THIS IS THE POWER DISC.
YOUR PLASMA IS NOTHING
COMPARED TO IT!
YOU COULD HAVE PASSED THE
FIRST PART OF MY CASTLE, 
BUT NOW, YOU'LL BE CRUSHED.
YOU ARE STRONG, IF GIVE
YOU THAT. BUT THINGS WILL
BE MUCH HARDER NOW.
THIS CAN'T BE!
I'LL SEND MY STRONGUEST
TROOPS TO STOP YOU AT ONCE.
YOU MADE THIS FAR.
I'LL RECEIVE YOU WITH
ALL THE MIGHTY...
OF THE EVIL GENIUS,
DOCTOR DESTRIN!!
